#Basic Usage 
from collections import Counter 

txt = "banana"
freq = Counter(txt) 
print(freq) 

#Counting Elements in a List 

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'apple', 'banana', 'apple'] 

fruit_count = Counter(fruits)
print(fruit_count) 

#most common 
words = ["hello", "world", "hello", "python", "world", "hello"]

high = Counter(words).most_common(2) 
print(high) 

#expand elements 
counter = Counter({"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 1})

c = (list(counter.elements())) 
print(c) 

#arithmetic operations 

counter1 = Counter(a=3,b=2)
counter2 = Counter(a=4)

print(counter1+counter2)
print(counter1-counter2)


print(counter1|counter2) #max 
print(counter1&counter2) #min 

#remove 

del counter1['a']
print(counter1) 

#defualt return types : dictinory 
#use cases : automatic counting , optimised for frquency , more builtin methods 
#*,// not supported coz , its not suitable for the counting
